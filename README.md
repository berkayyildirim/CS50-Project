As a civil engineer, I pay attention to the financial statements for the construction industry. Therefore, this project is to create a website that could help civil engineers with financial analysis. Firstly, the user should open the "Expenditure" to submit an expense. Engineers or financial analysts can select the type of expenses, enter the amount, write a note, and submit the data. Expenses depend on activities in the schedule (such as Mobilization, Excavation, Foundation, Structural, Architectural, Plumbing, HVAC, Electrical, Landscaping, Others). The website will return the pie chart and total expenditure for each type of expense on the main webpage. Secondly, to view all records that have been made, the users may click "History". Next, if there is an income from clients or contractors, you need to submit it on the "Income" page. Subsequently, this amount will be subtracted from expenses in the database. Since there are generally 4 main activities (Structural, Architectural, HVAC, Electrical) in the construction site, you can analyze the summary of your expenses in these 4 main types.
