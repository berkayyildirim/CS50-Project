As a civil engineer, I pay attention to financial statement for the construction industry.
Therefore, this project is to create a website that could help civil engineers with financial analysis.
Firstly, user should open the "Expenditure" to submit an expense.
Engineers or financial analysts can select the type of expenses, the amount, note and submit the data.
Expenses depends on activities in the schedule. (Mobilization, Excavation, Foundation, Structural, Architectural, Plumbing, HVAC, Electrical, Landscaping, Others)
The website will return the pie chart and total expenditure of each type of the expenses on the main webpage.
Secondly, to view all records that have been made, the users may click "History".
Next, if there is an income from clients or contractors, you need to submit it in "Income" page. Subsequently, this amount will be subtracted from expenses in database.
Since there are generally 4 main activities (Structural, Architectural, HVAC, Electrical) in the construction site, you can analyse the summary of your expenses in these 4 main types.
